# Reflection

* I planned this out in the beginnning, outlining a rough step-by-step plan. Knowing beforehand what needs to be done and having kind of intermediate goals was really good for motivation and keeping my coding focused.
* I was too lazy to do that in the beginning, but TDD would have made a lot of sense for this project.
* In looking back, I probably overdid the architecture. I am quite proud of the code and I think it reads pretty well, but for a game like this, it's probably overkill. Also, the abstraction of a single tetris piece into its own class adds more complexity than it's worth. It would probably have been easier to do movement and turning directly on the game board.
